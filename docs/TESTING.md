# Testing

Single reference for how we test intel-prep-ace: what already exists, how to run it, and what still needs to be covered.

## Quick Start
- `make test` – run everything (Deno + Node).
- `make test-unit` – fast unit sweep (current suite).
- Edge Functions stay in Deno under `tests/unit/test_edge_functions`.
- Frontend code should use Vitest + React Testing Library (planned; add `vitest run` npm script when suites land).

## Suite Layout

```

**Current coverage:** 28 automated tests (26 Deno edge-function unit tests + 2 workflow integrations) and all are passing. The integration slots now cover the full interview prep flow end-to-end.

## Key Scenarios
- **Test 07.1 – Complete workflow integration**: Located in `tests/integration/test_workflows/test_07_complete_workflow.ts`. Creates a real search, triggers `interview-research`, waits for the async pipeline to complete, then asserts CV/job comparison rows, ≥10 interview questions, stage generation, and cleans up the seeded `searches` record. Run with `deno test --allow-all tests/integration/test_workflows/test_07_complete_workflow.ts`.
- **Test 07.2 – Post-workflow database consistency**: Reuses the same file to trigger another end-to-end run (Meta → PwC scenario) and verifies every downstream table (`interview_questions`, `interview_stages`, `cv_job_comparisons`) references the new `search_id`, catching orphaned data regressions.
- **Next up – Dedicated CV/Job comparison edge unit**: Still planned to hammer the `cv-job-comparison` function in isolation (gap analysis structure, skill match %, fallback paths, and database writes) without waiting on the full workflow.

## Backlog & Priorities
Treat **P0** as blockers, **P1** as near-term, **P2** as nice-to-have if timelines allow.

| Priority | Focus | What to prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Search artifacts persist | `supabase/functions/interview-research` writes artifacts + comparison data, falls back on zero-row updates. |
| P0 | Progress + stall UI | `ProgressDialog`, `useSearchProgress`, and stall detection animate correctly and recover from retries. |
| P0 | Search creation flow | Authenticated submissions create searches, invoke edge workflows, and show accurate polling. |
| P1 | Practice session pipeline | `sessionSampler`, favorites filters, and session persistence remain stable. |
| P2 | Tavily analytics math | Metrics/credit math in `tavilyAnalyticsService` stays accurate on empty + happy paths. |

### P0 Details
- **Search artifact persistence & CV-job comparison**
  - Files: `supabase/functions/interview-research/index.ts`, `_shared/progress-tracker.ts`, `src/services/searchService.ts`, related migrations.
  - Tests: Deno unit for `saveToDatabase` (update/insert/upsert paths, progress timestamps) plus integration assertion that `search_artifacts` + `cv_job_comparisons` stay in sync with `searchService.getSearchResults`.
- **Progress & stall detection UI**
  - Files: `src/components/ProgressDialog.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSearchProgress.ts`, `src/pages/Home.tsx`.
  - Tests: Vitest/RTL states (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, stalled >45s), adaptive polling intervals with fake timers, retry CTA toggles, toast usage mocked.
- **Search creation & polling flow**
  - Files: `src/pages/Home.tsx`, `src/services/searchService.ts`.
  - Tests: form submission happy/error paths, Supabase client mocks for `createSearchRecord/startProcessing/getSearchStatus`, polling timeouts (warnings at 2.5m, fail at 8m).

### P1 – Practice pipeline
- Files: `src/pages/Practice.tsx`, `src/services/sessionSampler.ts`, `src/services/searchService.ts` practice helpers.
- Tests: sampler sizing + randomness (seeded RNG), UI filters (favorites-only, stage toggles), persistence helpers with mocked Supabase + localStorage.

### P2 – Tavily analytics
- Files: `src/services/tavilyAnalyticsService.ts`.
- Tests: Supabase call mocks covering totals, averages, ranking, cost conversions, and graceful empty results.

## Tooling Notes
- Keep Deno-based suites under `tests/` and run with `deno test --allow-all`.
- New frontend suites should add `"test": "vitest run"` plus `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`, and `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- Prefer lightweight Supabase client mocks; only hit the hosted project for end-to-end checks when necessary.
