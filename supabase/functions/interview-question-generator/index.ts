CRITICAL FOCUS: QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
- Generate 5-8 questions per category (30-50 total) that are DEEPLY TAILORED
- Each question MUST reference specific details from the candidate's background, job requirements, or company research
- Better to have 30 highly relevant questions than 100 generic ones

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
1. RESEARCH-FIRST APPROACH: Prioritize questions derived from actual company interview experiences and research
2. DEEP TAILORING: 100% of questions must reference specific details:
   - Candidate's specific work history, projects, or achievements
   - Specific job responsibilities and requirements
   - Company-specific information, culture, or research findings
   - Real interview questions extracted from candidate reports
3. ADAPTIVE COMPLEXITY: Adjust question complexity based on candidate's experience level
4. REAL QUESTIONS: Use actual questions from interview reviews as foundation, then create tailored variations
5. STAGE-APPROPRIATE: Questions must align with the specific interview stage and interviewer type
6. EXPERIENCE-MATCHED: Question complexity and focus must match candidate's experience level

TARGET VOLUME:
- TOTAL: 30-50 questions across all categories (5-8 per category)
- Focus on QUALITY and TAILORING, not quantity
- Each question should be unique and highly relevant

For each question, provide:
- The specific question (MUST reference specific details from context)
- Question type and difficulty (adjust difficulty based on candidate experience)
- Rationale for why this question would be asked (reference specific company/job/CV details)
- Suggested answer approach
- Evaluation criteria interviewers would use
- Potential follow-up questions
- Whether it's suitable for STAR method
- Company-specific context (MUST include specific company details)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - STRICTLY ENFORCE:
- DEEP TAILORING: Every question must reference specific details from:
  * Candidate's work history, projects, achievements, or skills
  * Job responsibilities, requirements, or qualifications
  * Company culture, values, interview philosophy, or real interview questions
- RESEARCH-DRIVEN: If company research contains actual interview questions, use them as foundation and create tailored variations
- EXPERIENCE ADAPTATION: Adjust question complexity and focus:
  * Junior (0-2 years): Focus on fundamentals, learning scenarios, basic problem-solving - reference their projects/education
  * Mid-level (3-7 years): Focus on project ownership, technical depth, team collaboration - reference their work achievements
  * Senior (8+ years): Focus on strategy, architecture, organizational impact - reference their leadership experiences
- NO GENERIC QUESTIONS: Every question must be specific and tailored. Generic questions like "Tell me about yourself" are FORBIDDEN unless tailored to the specific context
- QUALITY DISTRIBUTION: 20% Easy, 50% Medium, 30% Hard (adjust complexity based on experience level)

You MUST return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure - no markdown, no additional text:
